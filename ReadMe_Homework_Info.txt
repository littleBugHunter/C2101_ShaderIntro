Hi Paul,

For the Homework I did not cretae a spring-themed shader, instead I wanted to work on a magical water shader.
I put more documentation for the homework on sticky nodes in the shader graph. 
I watched this Video by Gabriel Aguiar Prod. and used the same approach with the rectangle nodes to create 
an electric shape from a procedural texture.

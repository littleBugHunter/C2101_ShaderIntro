For my final submission I did two interior mapping shaders. I did it in Shader Graph first, using Tutorials and other forum threads. Using the Graph as reference I tried realizing it in code.

Side note for some shaders lying around:
The other shaders in the scene were also made with a lot of research. The foliage and Dissolve shader were made with the help of Brackeys, Tornado was made following a tutorial from Gabriel Aguilar.
The water shader was made following an official Unity tutorial. Ice started with a tutorial which was later reworked by me to be more procedual.
These shaders were made for getting into the whole subject and for testing cool effects.

The cube maps are from HDRI Heaven. The backface of the unity default cube is rotated.

This is a shaderprototype for our semesterprojekt.
I programmed a fully procedural level and made this shader so that
we have 2 different ground textures.
At runtime the PCG Script would feed in the 0/1 for every direction
and every adjacent corner. 1 means that the next tile is blocked.
0 means theres another floor tile there.
For this samplescene (in this folder) i just assigned different versions of the same 
material... Theres also an Image (Blending.png) in this folder showing the old Projects
state where i used this prototype in the PCG map.

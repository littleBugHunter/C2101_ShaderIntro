For this shader i tried to approximate the old 3D movie look(without glasses ofc).
When i managed to do it, i decided to add movement and then so on... 
now it´s more like a: Hologram/3D/Glitch shader.
 I used mostly this:
 https://github.com/IRCSS/Geometry-Grass-Shader/blob/master/Assets/GeomtyShader/GrassShader.shader
 for the the geometry stuff. 
 And for the rest i mostly used Unity ShaderGraph node descriptions like this:
 https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.shadergraph@6.9/manual/Clamp-Node.html
 ..
 and ofc the other shader resources:
 https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-BuiltinFunctions.html
 https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-UnityShaderVariables.html
 https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/SL-UnityShaderVariables.html
 ...
 I also changed Susannes UV´s and experted a smooth version of her for demonstration.
The shader is fully coded but i experimented a lot with shadergraph.
